                        <h6 class="infoContentsTextDetail">This is where a novice enters the world of harness-and-rope climbing. When you’re top roping, the rope is secured to an overhead anchor in the gym. You tie into one end of the rope; the other end of the rope is held by a belayer, who manages the rope to catch you in case of a fall. The belayer might be a trained staff person, a friend with belay certification or an auto belay device.</h6>

                        <h6 class="infoContentsTextDetail">Once you've become a skilled top-rope climber, your next step is lead climbing. When lead climbing, you’ll tie into one end of the rope and clip it into a series of quickdraws that are already attached to bolts on the gym’s wall. Again, you’ll have a belayer.<br>
                        Lead climbing indoors is very much like sport climbing outside, except that indoors the quickdraws are already in place.<br>
                        The challenge with lead climbing is that if you slip or miss the next quickdraw, you’ll fall a short distance back to the previous clipped–in point. That’s a farther, harder fall than you’d have when top-roping.</h6>

                        To further define a route's difficulty, a sub classification system of letters (a, b, c or d) or plus/minus (+, -) is used for climbs 5.10 and higher. Thus a route rated 5.10a is easier than one rated 5.10d. A route graded 5.10- would be somehwere between 5.10a - 5.10b and a route graded 5.10+ would be between 5.10c - 5.10d.

Steel carabiners are much heavier, but harder wearing, and therefore are often used by instructors when working with groups.

                        Chalk is either pure MgCO3 or an added drying agent is mixed in. Each formulation has its fans. Some welcome the extra drying, while others prefer the feel of pure chalk and would rather not breathe in the added agents. The main difference with chalk is in the form:
                        <ul id='chalkTypes'>
                            <li><b>Block chalk</b> is pure chalk in a big hunk. The appeal here is less about cost savings and more that you get to crush it to your preferred consistency. It’s also less messy to transport before you crush it.</li>

                            <li><b>Loose chalk</b> includes both pure chalk and chalk with drying agents. The convenience here is that it’s already ground for you. Dump it into a chalk bag or ball and you’re good to go. Some brands offer finer and coarser grinds.</li>

                            <li><b>Eco chalk</b> is a response to concerns about visually polluting rock surfaces. Consisting solely of a colorless drying agent, it can be an acceptable alternative for gyms or climbing areas where traditional chalk is banned. Wash hands after use, though, because your eyes can be sensitive to it. </li>

                            <li><b>Liquid chalk</b> After you rub this chalk/alcohol blend on hands, the alcohol quickly dries, leaving a chalk residue. A plus is that it keeps both chalk dust and chalk marks to a minimum.</li>

                        <h6 class="infoContentsTextDetail" id="shoeDetails">Specifically designed foot wear is usually worn for climbing. To increase the grip of the foot on a climbing wall or rock face due to friction, the shoe is soled with a vulcanized rubber layer. Usually, shoes are only a few millimetres thick and fit very snugly around the foot. Stiffer shoes are used for "edging", more compliant ones for "smearing". Some have foam padding on the heel to make descents and rappels more comfortable. Climbing shoes can be re-soled which decreases the frequency that shoes need to be replaced.
